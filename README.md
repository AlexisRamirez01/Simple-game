# Simple-game

In this proyect, I making a simple videogame for the shell of `Linux`. This game is the adaptation of the classic game `Paper, Stone or Scissors`.
This video game has *two* game modes, a single game mode that is divided into `arcade mode` and `training mode`, where the *arcade mode* will be going
through and winning different levels against different people (computer) with different levels of difficulty. The *training mode* is a kind of training where the
user can choose the difficulty to face the machine.
Finally, the second game mode is a `multiplayer mode`. Is simple: as the word says, allows for a one-on-one confrontation per console to play with your best friend.
Additionally, the game allows you to save the player's progress while advancing in arcade mode and multiplayer mode.
The game is specifically made in Python and is compiled in a first version through the console.

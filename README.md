# Simple-game

This is a simple videogame multiplayer of cards, emulate the board game *`Agatha Kristie: Death on the Cards`*. The objective is very simple: catch the murder before he escape. 
The game is a representation of web game for the browsers, however, in this case the game is located in localhost for educational purposes. 
The logic of the game is simple: register yourself for create a new game or to join a existing game, later, when the lobby is full, the owner of the game start the game. 3, 2, 1...
DISCOVER THE MURDER, you and the other five players have a six cards in hand and three secrets. Play a set of detectives or any card to discover the murder, however, 
plan your strategies before the murder escapes and the most important thing: Don't run out of secrets or you'll become just another burden!!!
This videogame was developed together with my team from the Software Engineering course, to whom I am deeply grateful, 
and it was developed using Python with SQLAlchemy and FastAPI for the backend, while for the frontend we used React.js with Tailwind to structure the user interface.
Please enjoy it!
